		<p>The concept of reducing what is produced and what is consumed is essential to the waste hierarchy. The logic behind it is simple to understand â€“ if there is less waste, then there is less to recycle or reuse. The process of reducing begins with an examination of what you are using, and what it is used for.</p>
